# 3. Physics drive model (springs via motors)

LiquidFun (Box2D 2.3) has no spring on revolute joints. RagImporter emulates one with the joint **motor** and runs this every step, for every joint:

```
target   = resolved angle (rad, relative to rest): clip layers, then procedural overrides (§4.4)
error    = target − jointAngle
S        = jointStrength × rootStrength × runtimeStrength
G        = jointGain     × rootGain     × runtimeGain    × motor.gain
D        = jointDamping  × rootDamping  × runtimeDamping × motor.damping

motorSpeed     = clamp(G · error − D · jointSpeed, −motor.maxSpeed, motor.maxSpeed)
maxMotorTorque = S · motor.maxTorque
enableMotor    = S > 0
```

- `motor.maxTorque` (N·m), `motor.gain` (1/s), `motor.damping` (unitless) and `motor.maxSpeed` (rad/s) are per-joint **base values** set in the inspector.
- The channels `strength`, `gain` and `damping` (joint and root) are **multipliers in 0–1, default 1**.
- `S = 0` → the joint is fully limp, but **limits are still enforced**.
- `jointAngle` and `jointSpeed` are `GetJointAngle()` and `GetJointSpeed()` of the `b2RevoluteJoint` (rad, rad/s, relative to the reference angle, so 0 at rest). The outputs go to `SetMotorSpeed`, `SetMaxMotorTorque` and `EnableMotor`. These methods exist only on the `b2RevoluteJoint` wrapper ([§7.2](07-ragimporter.md#72-spawn-and-flipx)). This loop allocates nothing on the Emscripten heap ([§7.4](07-ragimporter.md#74-native-memory)).
- This model is the same in the editor and at runtime. The editor's Simulate mode uses RagImporter itself, so **preview equals production**.
